Learning Data based on a given examples file, where every line has characteristics and a single classification, in order to predict the classifications of a test file containing only characteristics in each line. 

The predictions will be made using the following algorithms: Decision Tree, Naïve Base and KNN.

Example is given in the code where the train.txt file trains the algorithm and the test.txt file contains examples to be predicted with classifications so the algorithm success rate can be checked.
